Naming conventions

Internal:

- Built-in protos are indicated with a simple lowercase identifier,
  e.g. 'string', 'bmethod', etc. The proto for an identifier FOO is
  found in builtin/FOO.scm. The "constructor" for a proto is
  make-FOO. The constructor for a clone/instance is
  new-FOO-object. The internal method definitions follow the naming
  scheme m-FOO-methodname (e.g. m-string-length).
