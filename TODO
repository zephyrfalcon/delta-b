# TODO

--- PARSER

- Needs more tests. "3 plus: 4" at REPL fails, for example. (But for
  some reason the same code works fine in test-parser.scm...??)  [A
  regex was fixed, but this part still doesn't work.]

- Empty statements should be allowed (i.e., a single dot).

--- TESTS

- We need a way to run all tests (and show results properly). See the
  Gauche manual.
