# MOTIVATION

An interpreted language written in another interpreted language is not
going to be a speed monster. In fact, it will probably be unsuitable
for most common tasks.

Then why write it? Because I have been toying with language ideas and
experiments for years. Maybe it's time that I take some of those ideas
and write a working implementation, and push it to its limits. If
nothing else, it will be a great learning experience. And if the
language itself holds up, or even parts of it, then those parts can be
transferred to a more serious implementation (with a VM, GC, etc).
